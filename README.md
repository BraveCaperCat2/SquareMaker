# SquareMaker
A C++ "Square Making" program using defined rules and other parameters.

A fork of "WordSquares" by CodeParade. For word-based squares, [this video](https://youtu.be/zWIsnrxL-Zc) made by the original creator is a great explanation.

## Usage
To use this solver, you'll need the following:
- A list of valid characters - For instance, this could be the alphabet or digits. It can even include special characters.
- A rule-set - Any set of rules to determine whether a row/column is valid. This can be a list of valid words, a condition for everything to sum to the same value or any other short condition. Examples for making Word Squares and Magic Squares are provided.
- A size - Any 2 numbers. For squares, the height and width should be the same.

## Note
This project is still a WIP. (Work In Progress)
It isn't complete at this time.
Current Status: No changes from "WordSquares", current usage instructions and description are incorrect for this version.
